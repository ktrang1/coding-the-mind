# Coding the Mind
## Brief Description
Given the explosion of knowledge about psychiatric disorders, our workshop and online platform (codingthemind.org) will delineate how a cognitive sciences and neuroscience approach can inform the selection, operationalization, and design of digital health technology to intervene in processes hindering wellbeing worldwide. More information about the impetus behind this workshop and platform can be made on [Background](https://github.com/ktrang1/coding-the-mind/blob/master/BACKGROUND.md). 

**The website will advance neuroscience- and cognitive sciences-based open digital health by**: 
* Providing a wiki on latest advances in neuroscience and cognitive science relevant to trauma research, filterable by biomarkers, symptom clusters, and estimated cost; 
* Aggregating available technologies and protocols (setup, analysis) for digital health interventions in trauma research; 
* Documenting past implementations of open digital health protocols, detailing successes, challenges, and findings. 

**The workshop will advance the field of innovative digital health by leveraging cognitive sciences and neuroscience to inform**: 
* Characterization of the bases of trauma response; 
* Selection of the types of technology suited for the problem specified; 
* Selection and operationalization of key psychophysiological, cognitive, and psychological parameters for routine outcome monitoring; 
* Determination of frequency and timing of ecological momentary assessments to discern fluctuation in key parameters, variation in cognitive and emotional processing, and looping effects meaningful for the prediction of future behavioral or clinical outcome(s) while accounting for placebo effects; 
* Design/selection of tools and covariates to disentangle the effects of social and physical environment on key parameters; 
* Design of alert systems to notify physicians and support networks for person-centered care; 
* Design/selection of measurement technology, user analytics, and field trials to assess impact; 
* And integration with open mHealth architecture that is sustainable, scalable, and amenable to user input. 

## Timeline
* March - May 2018: Partnering with community-based organizations and research institutions in LMICs
* May 2018: Launch Coding the Mind online platform to solicit feedback on workshop priorities 
* August 2018: Two-day workshop on Coding the Mind at Emory University (Atlanta, GA) 

## Workshop Format
The two-day workshop will consist of an open conference on the first day and closed working group session on the second day. The first day will begin with a series of presentation by the speakers, open to Emory faculty and students, and end with a poster session by students. Ample time will be built in for networking. The second day will consist of a closed session for speakers to produce recommendations for the named parameters and provide suggestions for 1-2 pilot studies, which could be funded by the Health Innovation Program or Global Health Institute at Emory, and the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation.
