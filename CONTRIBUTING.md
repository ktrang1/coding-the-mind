# Contributing to Coding the Mind

Welcome to the Coding the Mind GitHub Repository, and thank you for thinking about contributing! At the time of this writing (March 21, 2018), the project is still under construction. However, more information will be added soon on how to contribute. Much thanks for your patience!

The point of this file is to make it very easy for you to get invovled! If you have any questions that are not covered in the below, please let us know! Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

The easiest way for you to contribute is if you have a free [Github account][link_github] and sign in. Here are some [instructions]

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
* [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)

## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team.

(If you're here you ***already are*** a member of the Coding the Mind team.)

We will soon be adding labels! Stayed tune. 

GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about [discussing projects in issues][link_discussingissues].

## Get in Touch
If you have a question or comment, we'd love for you to [open an issue][link_issues] because that will be our fastest way of communicating, getting the answers to you, and (if necessary) making a change.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Brain Networks in Python Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
